# AVH VIO Blinky example

The **Blinky** example is a simple demonstration of Python VIO module interaction with the application running on AVH model. Application VIO (LEDs, buttons) is therefore handled with Python script. Status of LEDs is printed to the terminal like `LED: 00000000`, where each digit represents one LED (e.g. `LED: 00000001` means LED0 ON). The same applies to buttons, which will be presented as `BTN: 00000000` in the terminal.

Numeric keys from `0` to `7` on PC keyboard are mapped to `vioButton0` through `vioButton7` respectively and can be used to interact with the application.
>Note: Terminal printing LED status must have focus for key input to be registered.

## Operation

- In the beginning `vioLED0` blinks in 1 s interval. After 15 s the Python script will automatically *press* `vioButton0`.
- Blinking rate of `vioLED0` changes and `vioLED1` also starts blinking. Event on `vioLED1` triggers an automatic event on `vioButton0` which is delayed by 5 s.
- After 5s `vioLED1` stops blinking and blinking rate of `vioLED0` has returned to 1 s interval.
- After 25 s have passed, the Model will be automatically stopped by the Python script. 

# Prerequisites

- [CMSIS-Toolbox 1.5.0](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/releases/tag/1.5.0) or later
- Arm Compiler 6.18 or later

## Linux machines
Install Python `getch` package with:
```
pip3 install py-getch
```

# Build

1. Use the `csolution` command to create `.cprj` project files.
   ```
   csolution convert -s Blinky.csolution.yml
   ```
2. Use the `cbuild` command to create executable files.
   ```
   cbuild Blinky.Debug+AVH.cprj
   cbuild Blinky.Release+AVH.cprj
   ```

# Run
## AVH Target

Execute the following steps:
 - run the VHT model from the command line by executing:
   ```
   VHT_MPS3_Corstone_SSE-300 -f ./fvp_config.txt -V ./Python out/Blinky/AVH/Debug/Blinky.axf
   ```
- Press key `0` on PC keyboard to change LED blinking rate.
